## Description

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. 

### How has been created 

The front-end has been created by following the guidelines provided [here](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html#creating-a-vue-application):
```sh
npm init vue@latest
Need to install the following packages:
  create-vue@3.4.0

Scaffolding project in /ull-tfg/template-project-full-stack/front-end...

Done. Now run:

  cd front-end
  npm install
  npm run lint
  npm run dev
```
#### Vuetify

Once the project of the front-end has been created, [Vuetify](https://www.vuetify.com) is added. For doing this, [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/#getting-started) must be installed:
```sh
sudo npm install -g @vue/cli
```
When [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/#getting-started) is installed, [Vuetify](https://www.vuetify.com) is added to the project:
```
vue add vuetify
```
The result is as follows:
```sh
? Still proceed? Yes

## How to use

### Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```
The results must be similar to this:
```sh
added 571 packages, and audited 572 packages in 49s

115 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities
```

#### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

The Vite development server can be started by running the following commands:
```sh
npm run dev
```
The result must be similar to this:
```sh
  VITE v3.2.3  ready in 506 ms

  âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  âžœ  Network: use --host to expose
```
The front-end should be available by accesing to `http://localhost:5173/`.

#### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

#### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

#### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

#### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
